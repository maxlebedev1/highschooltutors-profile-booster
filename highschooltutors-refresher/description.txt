Hi there! I'm Max, a current student at UNSW studying a Bachelor in Computer Science. 

It likely isn't a coincidence you clicked on my profile. I'm on the top for a reason. I don't offer tutoring services anymore, but my profile is a showcase of my skills in reverse engineering and web security knowledge.

If you'd like to know more about how I'm on the top and have a special 'Top Tutor' badge, please read the github repo below.
